# Tales of Innocence R Text Translation Tools

Work in progress.

## `extract.py`

This script extracts the text from the game.
It is used as follows:
```
python extract.py <source> <destination>
```
It is assumed that `<destination>` is a directory.
It is assumed that `<source>` is also a directory and has the following structure:
```
<source>/
├─ eboot.bin
└─ toirelease_data/
   └─ _Data 
      └─ ...
```
`eboot.bin` is expected to be the decrypted `eboot.bin` from the game, with the Sony header intact.
The sub-directory `toirelease_data` is expected to contain the decrypted and unpacked `toirelease_data.l7c`.

## `recompile.py`

This script recompiles the executable and data files with the translated text.
It is used as follows:
```
python recompile.py <source> <text> <destination>
```
`<source>` is the same directory as used in `extract.py` and is considered the template for recompilation.
`<text>` is assumed to be a directory containing the various `.csv` files with the translated text (basically the `<destination>` directory from `extract.py`, but with the translations added to the `.csv` files).
Finally, `<destination>` is assumed to be a directory. Its contents is generated by `recompile.py` and used for later reinsertion into `toirelease_data.l7c`.
